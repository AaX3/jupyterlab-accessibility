Agenda:

- What JupyterLab is overview?
    - Quinten: "Allows data scientists to track equations, do their work. Huge diverse group of people who use it. We are trying to make it more accessible, the color issue, the README. The just want overall to use our fresh eyes and lack of knowledge to create something a newcomer can pick up pretty easily."
    - Sara: "Jupyter notebook mixing code with results. JupyterLab makes Jupyter Notebook"
        - What are Jupyter notebooks?
        - https://anaconda.org/jbednar/plotting_pitfalls/notebook
        - https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#data-visualization-and-plotting
    - JupyterLab written in Javascript
- GitPod tutorial?
    - A cloud based development environment
    - https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab
- HTML CSS learning resource: https://www.internetingishard.com


## Sara's notes

Binder is a way to send a jupiter notebook and have someone open it in their browser and start playing with it. people use it for research papers. A way to host jupiter notebooks
more for something they can interact with and play with, but not really to save results. 

Gitpod is similar, more for editing code. Gitpod is persistant. 

Gitpod


1. Go to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab
2. Make a fork copy of the code, using the git icon
3. Change branch name to save your own copy "Checkout branch" in the "command palette" which you can access with CMD SHIFT P
4. On the bottom it says Open Ports, which you can use to preview changes to open on the side or in a new browser. It takes a while to start up, so if there are no open ports, just wait.
5. search click ... for more options, then look for files ending in.ts typescript to only show files written in code as opposed to .md markdown or something else
6. make your change to the code, save your code, and reload/refresh the preview to see if it was right
7. press the + to stage the change (like a draft), add a message, then commit by pressing check mark, which saves your changes with a name
8. it's still just on gitpod so to move it to github to share with other people, then you have to push the change. 
9. Go to github, open a pull request for your branch, to suggest your changes. There is usually a link that pops up to suggest you to open one.

If you want to make another change on the same pull request, repeat 6-8

To start a new pull request, or to switch to some other work:

1. 

Command Pallet: Open with CMD SHIFT P: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette
command shift p is to open a file
command > is to run commands like >push or commity
