- Saul: Come back, demo of "local development," split up into groups to try
  - Can either do it on your computer, or if your computer is too old in some way, can try [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [GitPod](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9883)
- Timing for this meeting
