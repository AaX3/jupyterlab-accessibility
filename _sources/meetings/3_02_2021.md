Goals for meeting:

- Review what we have learned so far
- Try out "local development" by "cloning" the repository on your computer and editing it there

Agenda:

- Quinten: Idea for intro/checking breakout rooms?
- Sara: Come back, divide up material we learned last time, break up and add PRs to add definitions of it.
- Saul: Come back, demo of "local development," split up into groups to try
  - Can either do it on your computer, or if your computer is too old in some way, can try [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [GitPod](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/9883)
