## GitHub
*   Pull Request (PR): A request to review and modify code. To pull a branch into another branch.
    * Pushing code is when you send it from your computer to Github.
*   Pull Request Review: Anyone can review any pull request, to say whether they approve of it or not. Some projects require a core project person to review pull requests, before they are merged.
    * Q: Can you review something after it's been merged?
    * A: No. You can only review pull requests, before they are merged.   
*   Merging Pull Request: To actually modify the branch to add the new code.
*   GitHub Etiquette: Say when you are working on something on the issue, to avoid many people doing the same work.
