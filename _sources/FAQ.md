# FAQ

## üéµ Started from the bottom

### üë∂ What is software vs hardware?
* Software is a collection of instructions for the computer. 
* Hardware is the physical components like a computer mouse or the CPU (central processing unit) which is the electronic circuitry that executes the instructions.

### 0Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is coding?
* Coding is writing software that turns that into the basic instructions that the computer hardware can understand.
* Computer hardware itself, like your CPU, understands only very simple instructions, like adding numbers, and saving and loading information.

### üëÑ What is a programming language?
* Instructions can be written in many different "languages." To make it easier to talk to your computer, people have invented languages, which let you write a "higher level", i.e. more natural sounding description of what you want the computer to do.
* People who talk to computers go by many different names. From most casual to "impressive on a resume" you can say: coder, programmer, software developer, software engineer, software architect (those guys make the big bucks!).ü§ë  
* Some examples of programming languages are JavaScript, Python, etc

## üíï Collab

### üå≥ What is Github?
* GitHub is like google drive + soundcloud + facebook for coders, a place to store code, post, share and discuss. 
* GitHub is built on Git which is a software for tracking changes. Everyone can independently work on their own copy of the code, and merge the changes together from different branches.

### üóÑ What is a GitHub Repository?
* This group is a GitHub Repository (not suppository)!üí© Repository or "repo" as they say in the biz is a collection of files and discussions. 
* You can click "watch" to get email notificiations for this group's repo, and feel free to post in the discussion! This is the main [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) repository, but you don't need to subscribe since it's a lot. 

### üåé What is open source software?
* Open source software is public, collaborative, free code anyone can use. 
* Individuals work on code contributions "locally" on their own computers and can use platforms like Github to collaborate.
* Wikipedia is an example of open source, not only by sharing the information, but the code for the website is worked on in the open on Github.

## üöÄ Project Jupyter 

### ‚òÇÔ∏è What is Jupyter?
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a non-profit open source software for data analysis that is worked on in the open on GitHub.
* Jupyter is a community of people who work together to improve the software. It doesn't belong to any one company, and is controlled democratically by groups of interested contributors like you! Also IBM, Amazon, Apple, Quansight, universities, etc.
* It is also refered to as Project Jupyter, which is an umbrella for Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, JupyterHub (we'll define these later).

### üìö What are Jupyter Notebooks?
* Jupyter Notebooks are used by students, teachers, researchers, statisticians, scientists, and anyone who needs to use programming to analyze data.
* Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive feature that lets you mix narrative, code, and results.
* Jupyter Noteboooks allows you to code across different programming languages. Actually, the name Jupyter is a combo of 3 languages, *Ju*lia, *Pyt*hon, *R*

### ‚öó What is JupyterLab?
* JupyterLab is for writing Jupyter Notebooks. JupyterLab is a software that lets you edit Jupyter Notebooks right in your browser on a website. So, Jupyter Notebooks is like images while JupyterLab is like photoshop.
* JupyterLab is mostly written in JavaScript and some python but not everyone who works on it is a programmer. There are many ways to contribute that don't involve writing code such as design, giving feedback, project management, engaging with the community, and running events.
