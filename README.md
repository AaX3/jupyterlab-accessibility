# 🌱 Welcome

We aim to create a suportive environment where we can learn and hang out with friends. We are working on an applied learning project to make the JupyterLab community more accessible for users with disabilities. Most of us have little to no background with coding, and may not see ourselves as coders or belonging in that space. We care about lowering the barrier to entry to become involved in open source, so that these important projects can better represent the diversity of our world. 

We can contribute to JupyterLab Accessibility in ways that don't involve code. Our presence helps make a pathway to translate making JupyterLab more accessible to "non-coders." Hopefully in the process we will learn some code, which could even turn into jobs. However this isn't a coding bootcamp so definitely feel free to supplement with online courses like Codeacademy. Hopefully any confusion from this intro will be clarified in the following questions. First we'll start with some coding basics, ways of collaborating, Project Jupyter, accessibility, and meetings to plug into. 🙂 

## 🔥 JupyterLab Accessibility

### What is accessibility? 
* Accessibility is about designing for users with diverse needs. This includes visual (low vision, blindness, or color blindness), deaf/hard of hearing, physical, motor and general disabilities. Recommendations are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG.  Check out this [website](https://www.a11yproject.com/) to learn more and watch this 16 minute [webinar](https://mawconsultingllc.com/webinars/webinar-intro-to-accessibility/). ♿️

## 😎 Meetings

JupterLab hosts weekly accessibility meetings Wednesdays 1:15pm EST, alternating between JupyterLab Accessibility Quickstart (for newcomers!) and an all community meeting for everyone. Additionally, we will plan our own internal meetings to support each other.
