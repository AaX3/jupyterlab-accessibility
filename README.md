# JupyterLab Accessibility

Welcome! We aim to support each other in having fun and learning code through an applied project. People who talk to computers go by many different names. From most casual to "impressive on a resume" you can say: coder, programmer, software developer, software engineer, software architect (those guys make the big bucks!).  

This is a github repository (not suppository)! Repository or "repo" as they say in the biz is a collection of files and discussions. Github is like google drive + soundcloud + facebook for coders, a place to store code, post, share and discuss. Github is built on git which is a software for tracking changes. Everyone can independently work on their own copy of the code, and merge the changes together from different branches. 

What is open source software? 
* Software is a collection of instructions for the computer, unlike hardware such as a computer mouse.
* Open source software is public, collaborative, free code anyone can use.

What is Jupyter?
* Jupyter is a community of people who work together to improve the software. It doesn't belong to any one company, and is controlled democratically but groups of interested contributors like you! Also IBM, Amazon, Apple, Quansight, universities, etc.

What is Jupyter Notebooks?
* Jupyter notebooks are used by students, teachers, researchers, statisticians, scientists, and anyone who needs to use programming to analyze data.
* Jupyter notebooks is an interactive feature that lets you mix narrative, code, and results.
* Jupyter noteboooks allows you to code across different programming languages. Actually, the name Jupyter is a combo of 3 languages, *Ju*lia, *Pyt*hon, *R*

What is Jupyter Lab?
* Jupyter lab is behind the scenes of Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter lab is software that lets you edit how Jupyter notebooks works right in your browser on a website.

So what are we doing?
* We will be learning code by participating in the work the [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) community is doing to make it more accessible for users with disabilities. This is based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG. This includes:
** visual impairment like low vision, blindness, or color blindness
** deaf or hard of hearing
**
